    <div class="preface set-front-matter">
        <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
        <p>Sketch is a vector-based design app that has become a well-established tool for interface designers, mainly due to its ability to export assets in a variety of resolutions.</p>
        <p>It takes web and app design to a new level, thanks to its minimalist approach to software design and intuitive features such as Smart Guides, Shared Styles and the ability to export layers on a whim.</p>
        <p>Sketch offers features that are particularly important to user interface designers: an improved method of aligning layers or even entire components; the ability to export layers in a variety of resolutions; the functionality to save styles that can be reused time and time again; and, perhaps most importantly, ways to accomplish these things without having to dig through menus or to use complex keyboard shortcuts.</p>
        <p>Not only has Photoshop started to adopt some of Sketch’s most useful concepts, but Sketch has begun to return the favor. An intense rivalry is forcing a huge shift in the way we design for screens—at a rate so accelerated that it’s a particularly exciting time to be a user interface designer.</p>
        <p>For the number crunchers out there, the Subtraction Design Tools Survey<span class="fn">http://tools.subtraction.com/interface-design.html</span> explains that 34% of designers use Sketch for interface design, in comparison to the 29% that use Adobe Photoshop. It could be argued that Photoshop is only just behind Sketch because Photoshop (along with the other Adobe apps) is available for both Windows and Mac, while Sketch is only available to Mac OS X users.</p>
        <figure class="imagefig">

            <figcaption>34% of interface designers use Sketch</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2 id="what-sketch-is">What Sketch Is</h2>
        <p>Sketch is a Mac app that’s particularly popular for designing user interfaces. Being a vector-based tool, it’s also well suited to icon and logo design. It plays a similar role to Adobe’s Illustrator and Fireworks apps (the latter of which has now been abandoned by Adobe).</p>
        <p>Bohemian Coding, the company behind Sketch, says it has no plans to make a Windows OS counterpart, because Sketch is built on native Mac OS code that allows extra functionality, such as version history. Not only does that also keep Sketch running smoothly, but it means Bohemian Coding can design Sketch to look and feel like a Mac app. </p>
        <h2 id="why-sketch-gets-compared-with-photoshop">Why Sketch Gets Compared with Photoshop</h2>
        <p>From a practical point of view, comparing Sketch (a user interface design tool) with Photoshop (a <em>photo</em> manipulation tool) doesn’t make sense. However, designers <em>do</em> compare them, because Photoshop has long been an industry standard for designers of all types. In the past, there was less of a focus on user interface design, and thus there weren’t apps catering for it specifically. </p>
        <p>Photoshop is the main tool that Sketch users have been switching <em>from</em>, so that’s what Sketch tends to be compared with, even though Photoshop doesn’t look or act much like Sketch. Being a vector-based app <em>not originally designed to manipulate photos</em>, Sketch is more akin to Fireworks and Illustrator than to Photoshop.</p>
        <h2 id="what-sketch-isn-t">What Sketch Isn’t</h2>
        <p>Sketch isn’t a multi-functional (or over-functional) tool like Photoshop. Because of this, it has a much cleaner, more minimal user interface that makes designing with it a complete delight. Sketch was built for designing web and app components and nothing else—and its user interface reflects that. </p>
        <p>The images below highlight the distinct difference between Sketch’s interface and Photoshop’s.</p>
        <figure class="imagefig">
            <img src="../images/C1/sketch-ui.png">
            <figcaption>Sketch’s minimal interface</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="imagefig">
            <img src="../images/C1/PS-ui.png">
            <figcaption>Photoshop’s not-so-minimal interface</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Photoshop has begun to implement some of Sketch’s best features—such as <strong>Artboards</strong>, <strong>Smart Guides</strong> and the critically-acclaimed <strong>Export</strong> function (which Photoshop calls “Generate Assets”). However, Photoshop isn’t (and never has been) specifically built for designing interfaces, and it still lacks much of what user interface designers need, while offering too much of what interface designers <em>don’t</em> need. Sketch’s relative simplicity also lends it greater speed and intuitiveness.</p>
        <p>Quite intentionally, Sketch doesn’t offer image editing functionality—even though it does have tools for simple blurring and color management. So it’s definitely not a replacement for Photoshop in that respect. </p>
        <h2 id="comparing-sketch-photoshop-and-illustrator">Comparing Sketch, Photoshop, and Illustrator</h2>
        <p>No one tool can do everything, so it’s useful to be clear on what each tool does best. Here’s a simple guide to which tools to use for various tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Sketch is best suited for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>designing vector-based icons</li>
            <li>creating basic logos and logotypes</li>
            <li>designing web or app user interfaces</li>
            <li>working with basic SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Photoshop is best suited for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>manipulating bitmap images</li>
            <li>making 3D or highly detailed imagery</li>
            <li>painting digital artworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Illustrator is best suited for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>illustrating digital artworks</li>
            <li>designing complex icons</li>
            <li>working with highly detailed typography</li>
            <li>graphic designing with vector requirements</li>
            <li>working with elaborate SVGs for the web</li>
            <li>designing <em>complex print</em> media</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="trialing-and-buying-sketch">Trialing and Buying Sketch</h2>
        <p>You can snag a trial copy on Sketch’s website<span class="fn">https://www.sketchapp.com</span>. Though originally available via the Mac App Store, Bohemian Coding now requires the app to be purchased directly from its site, as that ensures third-party integrations will work correctly. The only other requirement is that your Mac is running at least OS X 10.9, also known as <strong>Mavericks</strong>. When the trial runs out, Sketch is $129.</p>

        <h2 id="preface-who-should-read-this-book">Who Should Read This Book</h2>

        <p>This book is for beginner to intermediate level web designers. You don’t need any prior experience with Sketch, although some experience with another design tool, such as Photoshop, will be useful.</p>

        <h2 id="preface-conventions-used">Conventions Used</h2>

        <p>You’ll notice that we’ve used certain typographic and layout styles throughout this book to signify different types of information. Look out for the following items.</p>

        <h3>Code Samples</h3>

        <p>Code in this book is displayed using a fixed-width font, like so:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;h1&gt;A Perfect Summer's Day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely day for a walk in the park. The birds were singing and the kids were all back at school.&lt;/p&gt;
			</code></pre>

        <p>If the code is to be found in the book’s code archive, the name of the file will appear at the top of the program listing, like this:</p>

        <figure class="codefig">
            <figcaption>example.css</figcaption>
            <pre><code class="language-css">
        .footer {
            background-color: #CCC;
            border-top: 1px solid #333;
        }
        </code></pre>
        </figure>

        <p>If only part of the file is displayed, this is indicated by the word <em>excerpt</em>:</p>

<figure class="codefig">
<figcaption>example.css <em>(excerpt)</em></figcaption>
<pre><code class="language-css">
    .footer {
        background-color: #CCC;
        border-top: 1px solid #333;
        }
    </code></pre>
        </figure>

        <p>If additional code is to be inserted into an existing example, the new code will be displayed in bold:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
 function animate() {
  <strong>new_variable = "Hello";</strong>
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Where existing code is required for context, rather than repeat all of it, ⋮ will be displayed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function animate() {
    ⋮
<strong>new_variable = "Hello";</strong>
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Some lines of code should be entered on one line, but we’ve had to wrap them because of page constraints. An ➥ indicates a line break that exists for formatting purposes only, and should be ignored:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
URL.open("http://www.sitepoint.com/responsive-web-design-real-user-testing/?responsive1");
</code></pre>

            <h1 id="chapter-1-sketch-s-interface">Sketch’s Interface</h1>

        </div>
        <p>It’s often said that the best user interfaces are invisible, or “the best interface is no interface”. A feature that simply works by itself—without requiring interaction with the interface—is the ideal approach to completing an action, while those that require several interactions are less than optimal.</p>
        <p><strong>Smart Guides</strong> is one such feature of Sketch that mostly works without having to interact further with the canvas, showing you the distance of a layer relative to another layer <em>while</em> you drag it across the canvas. There’s <em>no interface</em> for that.</p>
        <p>Sketch also has a concise list of easy-to-remember keyboard shortcuts like <strong>R</strong> for Rectangle, enabling the user interface to be quite small. While it may seem a little bare in comparison to apps like Photoshop and Illustrator, Sketch is <em>anything</em> but limited. You can open yourself to an extremely efficient workflow if you learn the keyboard shortcut equivalent to each interaction, although you won’t find Sketch difficult if you work better with a mouse. Your only real limitation is your creativity.</p>
        <h2 id="at-a-glance-comparing-sketch-to-adobe-s-apps">At a Glance: Comparing Sketch to Adobe’s Apps</h2>
        <p>Despite Adobe introducing a fresh, flat design skin to its user interfaces back in December 2015, these interfaces are still rather clunky in comparison to Sketch. Sketch has a Layer List, an Inspector and of course a toolbar, whereas Adobe apps have the option to add and remove tools from the workspace. Sketch has a single, default workspace that’s easier for a learner to master.</p>
        <p>Everything Sketch has to offer can be visible on the screen all at once: there’s no need to optimize workspaces.</p>
